    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>This page tells you a little more about me. Like you may be wondering what creature can live at Nemo Point and how they got a working computer. <i>Keep Wondering</i>.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I like to go for morning "runs" around the ocean gyre. There's so much to see, like:
      <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Wreckage</li>
        <li><strong>The Fathomless Abyss</strong></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <p>I'm also interesed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game#:~:text=A%20tabletop%20role%2Dplaying%20game%20(TTRPG%20or%20TRPG)%2C,characters'%20actions%20through%20speech%20and%20sometimes%20movements.&text=Some%20common%20examples%20of%20tabletop%20role%2Dplaying%20games,&%20Dragons%2C%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu%2C%20and%20Pathfinder.">TTRPGs</a> but I can't find anyone to play with.
