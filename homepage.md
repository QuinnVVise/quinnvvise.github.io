# About Me

Hello, my name is Alden and I live at Point Nemo (like Captain Nemo from *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*) in the Pacific Ocean.

## Point Nemo

You may be wondering: What is Point Nemo? It's the location in the ocean that is farthest from any land, known as a "Pole of Inaccessibility" and the "Loneliest Place on Earth." It is about **2,688 kilometers** or **1,450 nautical miles** from the nearest land: Durcie Island to the north and Maher Island (part of Antarctica) to the south. 

### A Graveyard

Point Nemo is a dead zone, devoid of even microscopic life, but that's not the only type of graveyard it is. The remains of over 260 spacecrafts and satellites rest on Point Nemo's sea floor, including:

-The space station *[Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir)*
-JAXA's *[Kounotori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II_Transfer_Vehicle)*
-Russia's *[Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_(spacecraft))*
