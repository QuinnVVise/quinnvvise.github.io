## Point Nemo

You may be wondering: What is Point Nemo? It is the location in the ocean that is farthest from any land, known as the "Point of Isolation" or the "Lonliest Place in the World." It is about **2,688 kilometers** or **1,450** nautical miles from the nearest land, Durcie Island to the north and Maher Island (part of Antarctica) to the south.
