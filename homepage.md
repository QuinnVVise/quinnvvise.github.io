# About Me

Hello, my name is Alden and I live at Point Nemo (like Captain Nemo from *Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*) in the Pacific Ocean.

## Point Nemo

You may be wondering: What is Point Nemo? It's the location in the ocean that is farthest from any land, known as a "Pole of Inaccessibility" and the "Loneliest Place on Earth." It is equidistant from the three nearest landforms: Durcie Island, Motu Nui, and Maher Island (part of Antarctica) making the closest humans the astronauts aboard **The International Space Station** whenever it swings by, about 250 miles above Earth.

| Place | Distance to Point Nemo |
| --- | ---|
| Durcie Island | 1,670 mi |
| Motu Nui | 1,670 mi |
| Maher Island | 1,670 mi |
| International Space Station | 250 mi* |

### A Graveyard

Point Nemo is a dead zone, lacking even in aquatic life, but that's not the only type of graveyard it is. The remains of over 260 spacecrafts and satellites rest on Point Nemo's sea floor, including:

- The space station *[Mir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir)*
- JAXA's *[Kounotori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II_Transfer_Vehicle)*
- Russia's *[Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_(spacecraft))*
